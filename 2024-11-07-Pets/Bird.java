  //6.Override the speak() method.
  /*WITHOUT REPEATING CODE:
  print the following message replacing the ? with name/age/noise/color/height:
    My name is ?.
    I am ? years old.
    I say ?.
    My feathers are colored ?
    I am ? inches tall
  */
  //You can call the old method using super.speak();
  //public void speak(){}



  //7:Override the getName() method so that a bid's name is "The Mighty NAME" instead of "NAME"
  //e.g. "The Mighty Polly" instead of just "Polly"
  //You can call the superclass' getName method using the syntax: super.getName()

  //Step 8:In Driver.java answer: What is the difference before and after you override this method?
  //What does this tell us about methods that are overridden?
  //public String getName(){  }

  //Go back and complete steps 9 onwards.
