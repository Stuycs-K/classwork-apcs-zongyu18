// speak() is overridden in the child class but not the parent, same with getName()
//Therefore, the String "The Mighty"  is added before the original getName() method
// We see this in speak() as well where the extra two lines of the Bird class are now printed
// The first two constructors work because they are creating an object of the same type
//The third one does not work because an Animal is not necessarily a Bird (Animal does not have all the fields Bird does)
//The last one does work because a Bird is an animal (i.e. Animal has Bird)
